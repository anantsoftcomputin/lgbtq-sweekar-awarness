        description: "Sexual orientation refers to an individual's enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attraction to others. It's a diverse spectrum, and individuals may use different terms to describe their own orientation.",
        note: "It's important to remember that sexual orientation is distinct from sexual behavior and identity. Someone's sexual orientation describes their inherent attractions, while their sexual behavior refers to the actions they take, and their sexual identity is how they label themselves. These three aspects may or may not align for an individual."
